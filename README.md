# CalculateTime
The myFunction function logs the time difference between the end time (Date.now()) and the start time (startTime) to the console.

The startTime is recorded before scheduling the function using setTimeout.

The setTimeout function is used to schedule the execution of myFunction after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds).

When myFunction is executed, it calculates and logs the time difference.

When you run this code, it will output the time difference between the setTimeout call and the inner function execution in the console.
